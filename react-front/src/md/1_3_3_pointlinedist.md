# Distance Between a Point and a Line

The distance between a point and a line is calculated here.
**You can set the location of the point by clicking on the canvas.**
The distance will always be the shortest one, and a line
drawn in that direction will be perpendicular to the original
line.

The formula for calculating the distance is presented below:

$$d = \frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + c|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}$$

The linear equation is of the form $ax + by + c = 0$. The point
is $(x_0, y_0)$, and $d$ is the distance.

There's a fixed line on th stage, to which the distance is
calculated.
