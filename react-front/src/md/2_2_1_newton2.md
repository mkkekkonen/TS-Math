# Newton's Second Law

Newton's second law can be stated as:

$$\bar F = m \bar a$$

where $m$ is the mass of an object, $\bar F$ is the force
applied to it, and $\bar a$ is the acceleration of the object.

This means that the force $\bar F$ gives an object with the
mass $m$ an acceleration $\bar a$-

**You can "draw" force vectors by clicking on the canvas and
dragging.** The force vectors are visualized as line segments.
