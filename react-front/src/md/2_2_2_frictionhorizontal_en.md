# Friction - Horizontal Force on a Horizontal Surface

Kinetic friction is calculated using the following equation:

$F_μ = μN$

where $μ$ is the friction coefficient and $N$ is the force perpendicular to
the surface.

In the case of a horizontal force on a horizontal surface, the *perpendicular force*
is:

$N = mg$

where $m$ is the mass of the moving object, and $g$ is the acceleration of
gravity.

You can input the mass of the object and the friction coefficient below.
Then you can pull the object by clicking on the canvas. Click "Start" to
